# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

---

1. **Task - Custom Makefile Syntax Highlighter**: Implemented custom CodeMirror language mode for Makefile syntax highlighting<br>
    **Result**: Created `src/makefile-mode.ts` with comprehensive token recognition for targets, variable assignments, recipe lines, shell commands, and variable references. Replaced generic CMake mode with Makefile-specific parser that properly handles Make syntax constructs.

2. **Task - Variable Reference Coloring**: Implemented distinct styling for different variable reference types<br>
    **Result**: Make-style variables `$(VAR)` highlighted with strong emphasis, shell-style variables `${VAR}` highlighted as special, automatic variables `$@`, `$<`, etc. highlighted distinctly. Added recognition for Make functions like `$(shell ...)`, `$(wildcard ...)`, `$(patsubst ...)`.

3. **Task - String Parsing Priority**: Fixed string handling to parse quoted text correctly before other tokens<br>
    **Result**: Moved string detection to top of token parser flow, ensuring single and double quoted strings are properly recognized and highlighted throughout Makefile content including in variable assignments and recipe commands.

4. **Task - Line Continuation Highlighting**: Added distinct highlighting for backslash line continuations<br>
    **Result**: Implemented detection of backslash at end of line with `keyword.control escape` styling. Regular backslashes in middle of text remain unstyled, ensuring only true line continuations stand out visually.

5. **Task - Custom File Type Icon**: Designed and implemented pale red settings/gear icon for Makefile files<br>
    **Result**: Created SVG settings icon with pale red color (#ef9a9a) to represent build/make files. Added pattern field to file type registration to match `Makefile`, `makefile`, `GNUmakefile` filenames. Icon displays in JupyterLab file browser.

6. **Task - Makefile Upgrade Target**: Extended project Makefile with upgrade target for dependency management<br>
    **Result**: Added `upgrade` target dependent on `check_dependencies` that executes `npm update`, `yarn install`, and `yarn upgrade`. Updated `.PHONY` declarations and bumped Makefile version to 1.25.

7. **Task - Icon Refinement to VS Code Style**: Replaced settings gear icon with bold capital M letter matching VS Code design<br>
    **Result**: Implemented SVG text-based icon featuring bold (font-weight 900) capital letter "M" in pale red color. Initial color #ef9a9a adjusted to slightly redder #e57373 for better visibility and brand consistency with VS Code Makefile icon style.
